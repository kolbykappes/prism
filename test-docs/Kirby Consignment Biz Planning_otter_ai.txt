Kolby Kappes  0:00  
Contract with the hospital we worked on recently. That's the context. It's been a shit show.

Speaker 1  0:05  
What has been so hard? It's been so hard to do anything. It's a more challenging job. Yes, if they've been fine with what they told kimley and Mary but the with multiple department heads and doctors approach us privately, like, hey, we didn't want we're not trying to get anybody in trouble, but you know, they're not really paying attention. It turns out, where the mayor's gone on the blink, they're not doing the city sidewalk. So all the areas that we have done in the past, which we weren't technically supposed to, but we still got paid by the hour. So it doesn't really matter, as long as we're there, we're getting paid by the hour. You want to be called for every minute we bill. Sure we get paid for. But we would go ahead and do these areas over the past years. And so again, in context, there for three or four years, Woody, myself, Mary and Mary's brother in law, and some flunkies and Sean and other people would help us. We did a really good job and made sure all those areas were out there in the middle of night watching people walk to work. We would just do common sense and watch bullshit. Man. They just had to walk through the snow right there. We probably hit that spot. 50 people walk through there and trample the snow. We probably should clear that spot. You get what I'm saying, just common sense stuff that makes sense. Children, my kids, and other kids do

Kolby Kappes  1:21  
not have makes sense so and so, because we had not been doing those they've been dissatisfied because the quality of the service we're providing is not as good as

Speaker 1  1:32  
an earlier years on paper, no problems at all. But what was happening is it was grumblings of people in the community unhappy, and it made us look bad, because we weren't. It did not look like good work. It looks 100 times better after curtain and the crew went back today. They're going to go back tomorrow and straighten it up. We typically go back a couple days after a storm and do the cleaning up. And anyway, it just didn't get done. And I was trying not upset. You know, screw it if I don't do this. I've got. I know how this works. I got. I drove down there, picked up the department head of business therapy, and we drove around for 45 minutes taking pictures of shit. Now it wasn't like a bitch out session or any means, but we did it to save face and to work, to work on our reputation, because we don't want reputation for doing shitty work. Absolutely not. So I've gotten messages back, and Kristen's got messages, and they're quite pleased, and we're gonna do some more stuff tomorrow, basically not doing the City sidewalks.

Kolby Kappes  2:40  
But who had the responsibility for this on our side? Was it our nephews, or was it somebody else? The nephews 100% and who was responsible for quality controlling a bunch of dumb ass teenagers? Apparently, no one. Well, that seems like maybe we've identified the first gap teenagers being dumb shits is just teenagers being teenagers.

Speaker 1  2:59  
Well, and on top of that, again, but I was there, I mean, Mary screenshot, and she told them the areas, and again, she was clear. I just don't think they wanted to sue it or something. And so after this, I charged the Kurt looked like asshole. The Pirate brought me behind. But the 800 or 1000 people at work here that walk through the snow and see us doing this know that's our company doing it. You don't think they're thinking why they didn't do a very good job. I don't like that yet, and so that's why we did it. We ate a little payroll in this deal to make it right. We'll make it up. It's not like we're not going to get paid for the hours and the materials we don't want. Simple as that, it might cost us three or $400 extra on a two or 200 plus $1,000 contract.

Kolby Kappes  3:48  
No, it makes all the sense in the world. What have we done to try and address it with the nephews, they had their butts chewed yet,

Speaker 1  3:55  
I don't know that we're gonna handle it that way. These young men do not handle that like that. So we're gonna Kurt is gonna address it. I'm sure Kurt ripped his son's ass because Bryson Kurt, Stanford, son,

Kolby Kappes  4:11  
is one of our Blake it feels like if we're, if we're concerned about hurting their fee fees, then I think each of us feels perfectly comfortable ripping our own children's asses. So just do

Speaker 1  4:21  
it that way. Well, that's what we're gonna do. So you but, but again, we had people involved. It was a hell of a storm to hit, and it's a big facility, but we got it resolved anyway. We got to resolve but it was just another thing, and this crazy bitch, Devin his wife, right in the middle of all this going on the shit show that happened. I don't know if Kinley said anything about the tires getting put on and ripped off by a huge amount on tires for Danny and the long trailer breaking down. What? Third or fourth

Kolby Kappes  4:51  
time I've not heard anything about, anything about these things. What's going on with that?

Speaker 1  4:56  
I just had to tell someone, because killing I mean, I don't. Unfortunately, Danny calls me blown out. He got tires blown out, a light brake locked up on the way back from Blue bank diesel to our house, our shop, which is like 14 or 15 miles. It cost us 1000 and some dollars, 1100 and some dollars to get get there, because he tells me he's blown and got tires blown out, the brake locked up. Well, the company that fixed the brakes came out there and they put the fix the brake chamber again. This was a failure of equipment from where it's been sitting for all these years. So the reason that we do the soft openings, and restaurants do soft openings to find what breaks the same reason I've been I have failed at quality controlling vehicles before they left here. Something that has an issue. Was not an issue now, but it was an issue because I trusted other people. The same thing happened. We didn't have time to go run this, throw some logs on it, run down the road. What happened? Lights all broke the air brakes messed up. Three or four different times we got labor, multiple trips of labor, and time involved, but he calls me in a panic until like he's about to cry, man, and I know Kelly's gonna be pissed. By the time I look back there, I'd gone eight or 10 miles, and I didn't notice back axle. I couldn't hear anything, you know, couldn't roll the window deck says eight degrees out and and then I saw chunks of rubber come off and blown. Two tires have been on the trailer for not even

Kolby Kappes  6:26  
a month. Let me see if I can repeat this back to you. So Danny is out taking the new log trailer for a test drive.

Unknown Speaker  6:34  
He shop to get ready to go to Virginia. He is getting

Kolby Kappes  6:37  
ready to go to Virginia a brake repair malfunction that caused the brake cylinder to activate him, because he didn't hear it, he basically dragged two brand new tires until they came apart to pieces and blew out.

Speaker 1  6:50  
They were used, but very good tires. So technically, yes and again, obviously that enough would have sent Kenley into a prison or me as well. But on top of that, he called somebody okay. He says, I'm stuck on the side of the road, your gene W construction, not a narrow spot. And I'm like, shit, man, the last thing we want is do team or the state police coming and auditing a trailer that clearly got problems. Man, I got a guys willing to come, but they're 400 bucks a piece. I'm like, man, it's a rip off, you know, but we need to get this trailer to Virginia. So I knew Kelly wouldn't be happy, but I knew he would understand. Here we are broke down the side of the road, sure. I reluctantly gave him that on the $250 service call, which is a rip off, just to rip this off into anyway. So I give him a heads up. Go ahead to do it. They get it done. And Kenley gets back and called and flips his get on me last night, like, Whoa. What's going on? Turns out Daddy didn't give me all the information. Happens a lot with him. He was at the fucking shop in town, and we had emergency road service come to our shop in our parking lot and break it off. And the four of them took turns tack demos.

Unknown Speaker  8:07  
That's not cool.

Speaker 1  8:09  
So and beginning to had multiple breakdowns trying to get the trailer. And Kelly called, and I guess Kelly's first response was, pissed off. Why the fuck would you do that? And of course, I made the call. He's pissed at me. They called me back. Man, I know I talked to Danny and I talked to Cody and Chip he wasn't sure what to do, and he doesn't know people here. And he handled it like if he was on the road, he didn't tell me, and he didn't call tell me anything until he'd already called people. It had people on the way, so we were out for $280 road service, no matter what, if we're gonna have to drag it back there, have guys on the side of the road and then drag it back to the shop, take the tires and wheels off, take them tomorrow to get tires mounted all the time, and labor, it's gonna be just as cheap just to get them fixed. Well, turns out he was at the fucking shop, and it would have been two $200 $100 a piece used tires cost us $1,100 that sucks. Now we have two fine, brand new tires on the back. Now I got to take those off and put them on something else, because I can't have two brand new steer tires on the back of my long trailer. So but he called me, said, Man, Danny was in tears over it, you know, and he's stressing out over this girlfriend broke up with him and all the world is ending. So I, I had to kimlin called my last night. Said, Man, I want you to go to the shop tomorrow, attaboy, give him an attaboy, pat him on the back, doing something, you know, I know how to do that. Sure, snow and ice, and he's at the shop, and the wiring is a freaking mess on that son of the bench, wire and disconnecting lights just no way you could ever get I could just see it. He was about to cry again. He was tore all three pieces. So no, I'm like, Danny, I got an idea. I said, Man, I got all the stuff. I do this every day in the shop, building harnesses and stuff for these trucks we built. I have everything you need for this at my shop. And it's, how do I way to get there? It's like, hop in with me. So we took the old lights, we went to my shop, and we go on the way there, I get a phone call that Devon, who we suspect had basically told him, We don't have any work for you for the rest of the week, showed up, and one of the guys look well, I thought you were suspended. Well, I hadn't told him that, and I didn't say those words, but that's pretty much, technically what happened. Well, then his wife, he was pissed off, and his wife pregnant seven and

Speaker 2  10:40  
a half men whined like a little two year old to the seven and a half month pregnant wife, and she showed up to fight his battle,

Speaker 1  10:49  
and she parked at the top of the hill and walked through that icy, literally bobsled run of a fucking road. And I'm like, of course, now I'm a real son of the bitch, because the bitch, because the pregnant woman just walked down here and I had customers. And customers showed up, two different sets of customers, and I had to go in the process. I The light place over the light where the lights clip into the log trailer had rusted out, so we're gonna have to fabricate something. And I called Stephen, didn't we buy some prefabricated light pockets just to keep this from happening? Because, yes, because we had one, we just welded it right over top of it, pop the new lights in. So then I said, grab one. We'd already ordered. It had it on the kind of inventory on the side, stuff we use constantly. I said we had lights for it, pigtails. Why would you I send you this out in 15 degree weather to put it together outside. So I went ahead and drilled a hole, put a grommet in it, spent the 30 minutes to heat shrink and and getting all the wires. And I had to make, take three pigtails and combine them into one wire and clean all that up and down. That down pocket together, all while these crazy, pregnant chick staring at Kelsey and Phyllis just sitting here. Just told basically before Phyllis walked in and just told Kelsey how much he fucking hated Phyllis.

Kolby Kappes  12:17  
That's an unpleasant day,

Speaker 1  12:20  
and I'm like, so I have to come over here, and I'm like, you know, I can't say much to you. I know Devin wants me to tell you, but he's not here, and I can't just, I said, we don't want, no. I said, No, we don't then she's like, Oh, well, he wants to, you know, take off. You know, he says we can take attorney eight to 12 weeks of paid paternally paternity leave, eternity, not maternity, but eternity leave. So I almost laughed out loud.

Unknown Speaker  12:56  
Well, so anyway, oh shit. Kolby, so

Kolby Kappes  13:02  
she didn't come away with paternity leave. She did not.

Speaker 1  13:05  
I told him he could take all the unpaid time off he wants. So and the reason she was looking here was there are programs available. She's in a high risk pregnancy. Kolby, okay, and so there are programs that will actually give him, give them money to be able to help her. It's not that, because this is actual thing that happens. They're in a tough spot. They don't have insurance. They've got whatever the free insurance they've got, which is not the greatest as you know, and every doctor's appointment they have to go to Devin has to take off work to be filled with it, because again, at the end of the day, just because they're broken poor doesn't mean that he shouldn't be there. Well, all this work, but there are programs available. So basically she I gave her my card and said, Here's the deal. Talk to your doctor if they need something emailed, you can email me a form to say, hey, our company doesn't offer this that would then make them eligible to apply for these things to help them. Like, I will do that. That's all I can do. Simple as that. She's like, why? But I don't understand why he's suspended. I say, look, it's not necessary. I said, but we were made aware of a situation involving time being changed, and we're we have to look into how we handle that. On, on, you know, we're new to this. You know, six months ago, we had eight employees, and all sudden, we have a lot more. So we have people. There are guidelines we have to follow. I have to do something. This is going to be documented. You know, whatever we have to do, there has to be disciplinary action involved in what happened. And I didn't tell her exactly.

Kolby Kappes  14:51  
Feel free on those sorts of things. Hopefully, doesn't have very odd, but feel free to use me as a bad guy. Send me a text and put me on the phone, bro.

Speaker 1  14:58  
I said, I have, I have a partner in a man. I have a managing partner that has to sign off on HR. People that sign up on this. We're new to this too, but at the end of the day, this is not something we're just going to you know, it was a mistake, because this was clearly done intentional. Well, I recorded the entire conversation. Well, I listen to Kolby so anyway, but again, just an absolute touching shit show of stress and crazy shit happening. On top of that, one of my very good customers showed up to get a pickup a rear end, and unfortunately, I suspended my parts pullers, so I had to bring Jordan over and Jordan and I was, I was helping Jordan, and Jordan didn't know how to do it. Okay, so Steven was in a stopping point because Eric couldn't, didn't show up today. So he got everything welding done on that, on the log track, and we needed, unfortunately, to prove a point. Cost me a day's work, technically, but I think they got the point. But so luck within Steven's, like Kolby, I can help him with this, like I know how to do this. So he came in and clock he was like, Oh, we'll get your time later. I'll get out the time here, and I'll clock you in under Super Duty, and I'll help him. So he helped him get the axle out, and then helped him get get it loaded up. I'll get it to the guy in an hour. I mean, again, he fixed the problem very quickly. I love Steven to death. I love him because he did. He came over and absolutely stomped his ass and got it done. And I'm like, you're like, Phyllis, how often I give the shit to this, Tommy and Devin. Here's a guy that doesn't do this every day, hasn't pulled a never pulled an axle for me, not one time they wouldn't spend a day on it. They had it done in less than an hour. So but

Kolby Kappes  16:57  
so did you guys hear about why we didn't have the money come until today?

Unknown Speaker  17:01  
No, we don't know. We just

Kolby Kappes  17:05  
some, some SON OF A BITCH went through and didn't send in the damn report, even though he said he did with a label.

Unknown Speaker  17:16  
You didn't send it to them. You believe that bullshit? That's crazy. It's that's crazy.

Kolby Kappes  17:24  
You know, you know who fucked that up? Sounds

Unknown Speaker  17:27  
like a Kolby situation.

Kolby Kappes  17:29  
That was, that was a Kolby situation. He goes, I said, Hey, how are you? How come you haven't sent it out yet? He goes, I don't see the label yet. I'm like, the fuck I God damn it, there it is, sitting in my drafts folder. Sorry about that. Here you go. Here's that label. Okay, I'll send it right out. Son of a bitch. Now he could have at least told me over the next two days, hey, I never got it, so I'm just fucking sitting there with myself. But no, I was the one who forgot to send it.

Speaker 2  18:00  
Okay, at least it wasn't been slow rolling at this time. That's right.

Unknown Speaker  18:06  
So that could have been, that could have been,

Kolby Kappes  18:08  
especially because we ain't out of the woods yet on this bullshit. We're still climbing our way out that we get these little drip, drip drips. Fortunately, payroll was super, super low this last week. That helps some. But yeah, what was the

Unknown Speaker  18:19  
check this time? How much was this one that was coming in? 195 oh, wow, that's the last one. Was only like, 100 and something

Kolby Kappes  18:26  
like 130 so. And, I mean, we've still got, we need, really, like, another half million to come in, to go through, and really start to have climbed out of this hole all the way. But anyway, there's enough, there's enough invoices out there where in the next couple weeks we'll get through it. This will let us continue to muddle through, and then by the time we get to beginning of March, things should be looking a little bit better. Appreciate it. Did you need me for for something else,

Speaker 1  18:55  
or sounding board? I need you to someone to understand. Okay, here. Crazy, 28 drafts today. Yeah, I'm really happy with my new hire, gold with money. Awesome spreadsheet. He's electrical stuff. Oh, I've never seen anyone better with Google Sheets or excel in my life, like he is a winner. That is, he had applied to be a professor and teach that, but they didn't get back with him. So he took my $15 an hour job because he was bored. He sounded exciting and different what he was doing. He already had insurance. He had an engine coming in, and he's only 49 he taught for 27 years, and he's done, and he's out, and he's doing something else, and he's gonna take he's gonna work four days a week. We'll figure out what those days are, nine

Unknown Speaker  19:51  
hours a day. You know,

Speaker 1  19:54  
he wants to work 40 hours a week or less, and I'm totally fine with that, but he's already, Kolby helped me paint the room. He helped put the outlets in. I mean, he did draw. I mean, he did all this stuff that on top of that. So here's the best part here, I basically don't have Tommy and Devin come in, okay? And we were doing all this construction work and working on hanging metal, putting insulation up. Well, Kimberly calls and said, Man, wickers needing, really wanting to work. He doesn't have any work to do. You got? Can you Can he do work? So I've had him putting up

Kolby Kappes  20:26  
that kid from the church. Is that who wickers? Yeah, church, but I don't know if he's putting that church. That's the only name I know a wicker from So, but it's,

Speaker 1  20:40  
that's Robin wicker's voice, one of them. But anyway, he was the one that worked for Barnett for so years, and Barnett just got tired of it. But even though he worked for Chris on the job and broke leg, falls, he's but he is a straight Kilby. He comes in and works, puts his head down and gets here and has done killer work, beautiful work, goes straight to work, I mean, and goes to his car and takes 15 minutes, eats his lunch that he brought with him, it comes right back up to work. Amazing work.

Unknown Speaker  21:12  
That's great.

Speaker 1  21:14  
00, supervision. John has required zero supervision. Kelsey requires zero supervision. Kolby now requires some supervision. That's what we have, fellas, therefore, so, but I am ready to, I'm ready to drop the hammer on the new company. Okay, I have so we're going on field trip in the morning. John and I are going over there to get a bunch of inventory, like a single box of maybe 100 items or more, more to bring here so we can have kickers and kind of have an idea and get a feeling. Because we don't know if that's a package of four or is there 10 fittings in that box for $500 or $200 or $50 he's working on the items that are the most valuable, first that they have the most of to kind of build our database around that.

Kolby Kappes  22:08  
So, so have we gotten enough details? We can actually write a contract before we get started on that all this. Remember, you're gonna send me what the outline of the deal was going to be about things that we cannot have a fucking handshake deal. We can actually document something,

Speaker 1  22:23  
yep, because that's why I want to get the account. Until we get the EIN number, eBay will not let us go live, right? But before

Kolby Kappes  22:31  
the EIN, we need the deal that I can put together tonight, if you'll just sit here and tell me what the deal is that this dude would agree to, and I can go document it, and then we can send him something to electronically sign, and then we could be off and running. All right, but the first thing is, you haven't already got I already have it on. Come on. Who are you talking to? All right.

Speaker 1  22:51  
Start now. Contract will be between Evans lane, owner of Altech. I

Speaker 1  23:04  
uh, which is a power cell phone tower construction company. Have a contract where we will, I will sell excess and surplus electrical wire, boxes, fittings, conduit and things along that nature of a commercial electrical supply, electrical components that he has currently in his warehouses, that I will sell those products for him online. I will take care of picking up the items, shipping the items, getting items paid for. And then once it's done, we will split the after the cost around all costs are done, we will then split it exactly straight down the money, 5050, so if it's a $500 item that cost me $100

Kolby Kappes  23:50  
to ship it package and he made things, what? What are the costs that are assumed to be in that list of costs? What are list off all the costs that you want contractually agreed to, because I assume he's not friends that's going to pay a portion of the gas bill shipping.

Speaker 1  24:05  
So yeah, the shipping cost, whatever the eBay fees cost, and

Kolby Kappes  24:11  
honestly, that's basically it, because basically cost of goods sold, but no SGA.

Speaker 1  24:19  
And then I will, is that right? We will, you know, every other week we will settle up on

Kolby Kappes  24:25  
whatever we owe. So what does settle up mean? Does settle up mean that, how are we going to go through and substantiate we will, bi weekly, bi weekly.

Speaker 1  24:34  
We will, we will settle with them. Bi weekly

Kolby Kappes  24:38  
on so the payout amount will be, then what sort of reporting will we provide to show that we're not cheating him or he's not cheating

Unknown Speaker  24:43  
us? It's the reason I started a new eBay account.

Kolby Kappes  24:47  
Okay, so we are going to send him. How are we documenting what our because what I what I think I'm hearing from you, is that he is going to go through and pay only for or the only expenses we're going to take out of it are cost of goods sold. We're not going to take any of our overhead. Going to take any of our overhead out of it, right? So none of our SGA expenses correct. So we are going to go through and just do that, and we will provide a report to him every two weeks. Then we will go ahead and disperse a check every two weeks for the previous stuff. Do we need to put something where it's like a week or two in arrears in case we get chargeback items, that sort of a thing, correct?

Speaker 1  25:23  
Yes, with that, do that. Okay, all right, I already have a sheet. We keep track of all that. I literally

Kolby Kappes  25:30  
how sitting on my desk. How are we keeping track of who has possession of what material that we make sure that people don't think that we stole it, that we documented what we took in the condition it

Speaker 1  25:40  
was in text. We send pictures, and I text message and send pictures to Evans directly. Okay.

Kolby Kappes  25:46  
And where are the materials housed? Before you take possession of them?

Speaker 1  25:49  
They are housed in his multiple warehouses on us 60.

Kolby Kappes  25:53  
So we need to figure out a way to because what I don't want to have happen that could easily happen here is, let's just imagine you, over the course of the next six months, take possession of $3 million of this stuff, and for whatever reason, either shit gets lost, shit gets damaged, shit gets stole by your own people, that sort of thing. How do we go through and mitigate that risk? Because you've now effectively taken possession of consignment items that are now sitting not in his possession anymore, but in yours.

Speaker 1  26:24  
Well, what we've been doing is what we plan to do Kolby, is to leave those items in his possession until we sell them and pick them up from his facility, so I don't have to warehouse them.

Kolby Kappes  26:36  
So okay, then we need to figure out what the process is going to be for us to effectively borrow the items and the schedule to return the items so that we only have certain items that we've documented on either side of that say, Hey, I took one of each of these pieces of conduit back to take pictures and to document, and here's where I return them. Make sense? And then you'll need to figure out and not let shit just start to slide by saying, All right, here are the things that we currently have basically out. So I think what you probably do is create some sort of like spreadsheet that's going to say, here's a log of what we've currently basically borrowed to be able to shoot pictures of or to create listing.

Speaker 1  27:15  
We have it all. We have everything in the room and technically in the new office and next to the office right now, every single piece is under lock and key now, and we now we keep that locked. It's not a nice warm spot for the guys. They probably that very first second that room was heated. It had a door on it. First thing that's where the guys came. John said that first thing they came in there to hang out and warm up. I said, Nope, sorry. Just got a key code. I said, here, and kelby's not here, and you're not going back and forth. That door stays locked

Kolby Kappes  27:49  
on the outside of the door. What now you have a camera on the outside of the door. Okay? That way we make sure the shit doesn't walk off.

Speaker 1  28:01  
All right, no, 100% 100% that's taken care of.

Kolby Kappes  28:06  
All right, I will get that written up and sent over to the next hour or so. All right, and

Speaker 1  28:12  
I'm gonna send you an email of the company information

Kolby Kappes  28:17  
in the company name. I'll send you a back on what I was needed to get it set up. All right,

Unknown Speaker  28:21  
all right, sounds good. Thanks,
