Kolby Kappes  0:01  
All right, this is a call with Kolby. We're talking about ragged mountain in the updates from the Faulkner call. So we had the call this morning with our normal Thursday call, and it was a super short call. Took maybe 10 minutes. It was just Milton Taylor, Stephen and myself, and so right out of the gate, I said, Boys, there's a reason I haven't given you a new look ahead, because we haven't done any more work. I said, we've been clearing logs out. I said, I think Cody and Milton have worked together on a few of the giant stumps over in Section 10, trying to get us better access into that area, I said, and I sent them the picture that you'd sent me, which was timely, right before the call started. I said, we thought that we were getting close to having things like where they'd break out. We have six inches of ice around our gear. I said, look at the forecast. I think it's plausible that we don't get out of our out of here until at the earliest next Wednesday, and it's even possible that not until the Monday after that are we truly out of the ice. Because you guys don't get to where you are is consistently above freezing until like Wednesday of next week.

Kody Kappes  1:19  
I'm not disagreeing to anything you're saying

Kolby Kappes  1:21  
so far. So at that point, they're like, yeah, we've been looking to forecast. But man, we had no idea the ice with acid. I didn't either. I said I was joking with Cody, you need to go out there and break out the ice a bit. I said, shit, boys, I don't know if you've ever been on ice before, but at two or three inches, a man can walk on it. At six inches, we might be able to drive a truck on that ice.

Kody Kappes  1:38  
Still, yes, I told the fucking surveyors, Kolby, they hiked out there to set up their surveying ship because fuckers on grass so bad. I told us that, boys, the ice is six inches thick. I was like, if you got the balls, it's gonna say I get two and a half hot miles of hiking. I was like, if you don't have the balls, just you have the information now. And the kid looked at me, goes, Are you serious? It's like, showed him the photo. I said, so have at it. You can get it done a lot quicker. I was like, but there ain't no boats going out on that fucking water this weekend all. It's probably, like, you said, nailed it, Kolby, I don't think we'll be out on next week 50 degrees.

Kolby Kappes  2:20  
Yeah, cuz I mean you, you guys get on like Monday and Tuesday and next, next week, your low is like 11, so that ice isn't getting thinner. You're not even gonna start thawing until that warm front comes in on Wednesday. So they said, What does that do? I said, Well, we've moved from where we were four to five days ahead of schedule to where we are now, on the cusp of losing at least two, as many as three weeks, which means that it's completely possible, or even likely, that we're saying we don't restart work with our barges until the 16th, which means that we more than likely need to the following we will need to work For three solid weeks as hard as we can and do six days a week. Be nice if we can do seven, but do at least six days a week because all our folks are hungry, and that we will move as much material Cody has cleared out the lay down yard, and he will have the boat ramp cleared out today, and that we hit it hard until our call that we will have on March the fifth, and on March the fifth, we will have had three solid weeks with hopefully good weather that we can go ahead and make as much progress as possible to cut down everything that is not in zone 14. And then we will sit down and decide, when do we need to start the nuclear option. And we will then meet each week, on the fifth, the 12th and then the 19th, and decide how we're making progress throughout March on when we need to deploy the nuclear option. Because understand, as we've talked about this for months now, when we start just cutting every damn thing down, it is going to be a freaking mess, and it is going to take substantially longer to clean up. So that was my next update. Anything you disagree there?

Unknown Speaker  4:03  
You're spot on? I said, Okay.

Kolby Kappes  4:06  
I said, so on 14. I said, Honestly, let's face it, nobody from RW say is going to 14. I know they remember it exists. And they laughed and says, Yeah, we pretty much feel the same way. I said, so at some point we will go over to 14, hopefully before the bat date, we'll see. We'll get over there and cut everything down, and we will chip the stuff into the woods, and 14 will be done. But for the stuff that everybody cares about, which is everything on this side of the interstate, we will do our best to get everything down. But worst case, we will decide at some point in March, this is when the nuclear option is deployed. This is when we are going to stop trying to move material off, and we are going to cut down every tree out here. You here. Okay? I said, in terms of what this does to our because they were all talking about, like their scopes and when they would need the barges and things. I said, I think you guys should adjust. I said, Cody and Melton need to continue to coordinate closely on section 10, because they're like, Well, can you bring more men? I said, labor is. The problem. All of our guys are sitting at home, hungry as hell, text and cake, and we come into work. I said the problem is getting access to being able to do effective work. So Cody and Milton need to work together on that problem, and I'm sure they already are, and we will bring out as much labor as we need, because we're shut down everywhere else as well in Virginia. So labor is not the problem, but those two can figure out what's the best way to attack that problem. They said, All right, well, I understand that Cody's bringing a bucket truck in. I said, Yeah, I think it's supposed to be in here today or tomorrow, and that'll give him more options for what they're doing out there. But anyway, they will figure it out. I don't mean more updates than whatever is the real time updates that Cody and Milton can get both of our teams over the next couple of days. Okay. I said, so the next thing we get into is in terms of timeline. I said, if we got to deploy the nuclear option, which it seemed we almost definitely will have to, then that means that there is no way that we have finished before the first of May. And so you should then adjust accordingly that when you need support for things like, you know, setting piles, or for, you know, getting the new floating bridge in place, those sorts of things that we will not demobilize our barges until the last thing that we do, in case we have to do any more warranty work as they are going through the thing. So assume that you've got access to our barges until at least the first of May. And they're like, Okay, we're going to look at our timeline and then adjust accordingly. Let me pause there before I go into the next thing, any questions,

Kody Kappes  6:23  
comments so far? No, I mean, then needing access to our barges definitely now is a much, much fucking larger problem than when we initially talked about all this, because I know that the way their motherfuckers work, that's going to be we just might as well assume that when they need access to a barge, we only have one bar today, right?

Kolby Kappes  6:45  
Because it'll be all day for them. Yep, I think that's I think that's a safe assumption. So the last

Kody Kappes  6:53  
means an operator, a driver, without the fucking barge all fucking day.

Kolby Kappes  6:57  
That's true. We're gonna let them drive our fucking barters so, so then we need to plan for that accordingly, which then means the the last thing, which was a bit of a surprise, they said, Look, we talked to our wsa, and according to the admittedly bullshit terms in the contract, we only got credit for one day in January. I said, Well, that is a lovely way to run the contract. I said, none of it matters, guys. I said, the bat dates, the bat date, we're not getting relief from that. And then Taylor pulled a rabbit out of his ass, and he goes our wsa has had every project with substantial weather impact, and all their contracts are in the same way, and all their contractors are pissed off, really. So they have made it known that they are open to the idea that the impact of us having to work deeper into April and even may, because we had to deploy the nuclear option because the weather has been trashed and the reservoir is frozen over for three weeks, is something that they are potentially willing to give us relief for. Oh, really. So what I need from you today is what you and I need to decide by the time we get it done with this call, is that we need to decide what a daily rate is for our operations, that we want to try and get them to pay 510, 15 of those days to cover over the fact that we haven't been able to work for literally three weeks, and that the nuclear option makes the undoing the stack of sticks problem a harder problem, and that we should be compensated for.

Kody Kappes  8:33  
It's hard to quantum quantify that, quantify that like,

Kolby Kappes  8:39  
here's how I was thinking. I was thinking that what we would do is we would just simply try and take a look at and say, This is what our operations cost is for a given day, and make it reasonable so that they have a hard time, you know, because I think if we make it a reasonable number, it's a hell of a lot better chance that they actually fucking pull the trigger on if we come back and go, it's $50,000 a day, they tell us to go fuck themselves. But if we come back and go, it's $10,000 a day. Dollars a day, I think there's

Kody Kappes  9:04  
a decent chance we get some money. My my number was 10,000

Kolby Kappes  9:07  
so let's I will try and back into the number 10,000 and see. Because I mean, honestly, that probably makes us whole. And so I think I'll go through and make it look like Addison shit together. So it's not quite 10,000 be like 9823 or something, but I think that's the number we go with,

Kody Kappes  9:24  
yeah, because, let's be honest. I mean, they're gonna give us an extra 100 video that we already knew we were working in fucking April and May hold right? So, yeah, we can offset a fucking whole barge, potentially, with some additional funds, Let's fucking do it, yep. I mean, I even think down to 5000 if we they give it to us. But 10,002 barges, four men, two excavators and a burn box. I mean, there's the 17 man crew. More rocking and rolling.

Kolby Kappes  10:01  
So, and that's what I was going to do, is I was going to show, hey, this is, this is basically, I was going to give them the totals of how we of how we came up with a number. And I was going to use just what you described there, which was to say, hey, it's this and this and this and this at these rates, which is what we use for the thing, because we also need to have the number make sense of the context of how much we're charging them, right? So, yep, and it's a big number out there. And so it all needs to tie together logically when they look at it, yeah.

Kody Kappes  10:30  
Because what I was trying to look at is, all right, we got 100 days at $10,000 you know, that's that's not terrible, because that's what our original and then all the additional costs and things, I think 10,000 is a great starting point, even down into some change like you're saying, quantify with the gear, the men, the lodging, you know, the expenses. And then also make sure you understand that every day we gain a couple minutes of working, yeah, and after March, 2 week March, we gain a whole nother fucking hour when the time changes. And I told all of my God is here, be prepared for the next two months to be fucking brutally long, six days a week from 630 to fucking 630

Kolby Kappes  11:26  
now we also need to be mindful that when we're running cruise 6070, hour weeks, that's a fuck ton of overtime. Yes, there's no way around.

Kody Kappes  11:35  
There's no There's no way around. They haven't said Kolby, five days a week, four days a week, a 40 hour week, doesn't get this job done in a fucking year. And that's I mean, and it's not like we have a bunch of cheap fucking laborers any longer, either we have plenty of those on other crews, but not this.

Kolby Kappes  11:55  
Speaking of cruise where, when are like Darren and Kenton coming back,

Kody Kappes  12:01  
I've told them, after looking at the weather, show up sometime on fucking Tuesday, they're gonna be hung over his fuck on Monday, right? Yep. So I was like, ain't no sense in driving here, Monday supposed to be fucking 11 degrees, right? Tuesday's supposed to be 50. But I showed Darren the photo of the ice. He's like, Are you fucking serious? I was like, sorry to get here.

Kolby Kappes  12:22  
I no hurry. Okay?

Kody Kappes  12:26  
Harbor wanted take skid loaders and shit over and clear the road in four or 14. I was like, waste of time. I was like, nobody gives a fuck about 14. Literally, nobody gives a fuck about it, right? If we do it in June, nobody would give a fuck about it. So we're not wasting resources and time and potential fucking up something to go to 14. We'll work on 10 and gold. Some of the guys may have to fucking hike over to fucking six and 12.

Kolby Kappes  12:54  
Yeah, they might have to, I mean, because that is the thing, right is, is that if we could figure out a way just to have maybe some crew start to get some work ready so the material can be moved over, even if we can't get the barge,

Kody Kappes  13:08  
there's some shit on ground. And 12 Kolby, we got 700 fucking logs on the ground.

Kolby Kappes  13:14  
Okay. Well, never mind, yeah.

Kody Kappes  13:17  
Like, what's so fucking bonkers about what we just did is we accumulated from the land, brought to the landing, and then called out of the landing over 350 logs in little over a week's time running one fucking barge. All right, can you imagine what the fuck that's gonna look like with two full time barges running. So you'll Yeah, and next week we don't get about any longer.

Kolby Kappes  13:49  
Yeah. You need to reach out to Kerby when we hang up here, and explain to him the timeline that we have to have no bullshit, the fucking log truck, fully, fully decked out, fully tested, ready to go where it is sitting, and have maybe, you know, like some of those folks, help bring it back as they come back over or whatever. But we need to have that thing by what the 11th

Kody Kappes  14:16  
I have to have it by Wednesday of next week. There is no fucking hippmans or butts Kolby,

Kolby Kappes  14:21  
so reach out to Kerby. Make that very, very clear, put it into the brothers thread, and I'm going to work on writing this thing up. Water.

Unknown Speaker  14:42  
Going to wander around.

Kolby Kappes  14:56  
Children that should be nice. Angela should be like no with this minimum. Fun thing. It was good timing. I was concerned was gonna be, like, in March or something. And I'm like, Oh, hey, that's good. And late May at that.
